# Power generation
Arc routers generate power only when items move, so a clogged arc router is dead.
This means that they may take some time to fully shut down.
[stat]Hint: you can control item flow with conveyors and electric routers.[]

# Fuel
[sky]Arc Routers[] will only accept core-storable materials as fuel.
Item conductivity determines [red]lightning arc[] length and count.
Arcs do a lot of damage so make sure to have lots of menders on-site.

# Bars
[sky]Arc Routers[] display the current [red]Arcing[] and [coral]Fuel burnup[] chances.

# Affinity guide
[red][[red][] = Arcing chance
[coral][[coral][] = Fuel burnup
[yellow][[yellow][] = Power generation

[stat]xN = Multiplied by N
+/-N% = Modified by N%[]

Multiplication is done first.

# Block affinities
The [sky]Arc Router[]'s stats change when adjacent to these blocks:
	Moderouter: [red]+5%[], [yellow]x1.4 + 25%[]
	[sky]Arc Router[]: [red]+1%[], [yellow]+50%[], [coral]x1.2[]

	Plastanium: [red]-2%[]
	Phase Fabric: [coral]x0.5[]

	Copper: [coral]x1.2[], [yellow]+40%[]
	Titanium: [red]+8%[], [coral]x1.1[], [yellow]+60%[]
	Surge Alloy: [red]x1.6[], [yellow]+200%[]

# Item affinities
These items modify arc length (2.5 tiles max each) and amount (by the square root)
Metals have increased maximum power.

[stat]These should only be used to kickstart fusion routers.[]
Neutron Router: 100x :)
Sand: 10x
Coal: 8x

[stat]Metals will do, conductors have increased power.[]
Lead: 2x, 1.5x
Copper: 2x, 2x
Scrap: 3x, 1.25x
Beryllium: 2x
Titanium: 3x, 4x
Silicon: 3x, 5x
Surge Alloy: 4x, 8x

[green]Plastanium: 0.5x (uses RNG to cancel arcs)[]

Everything else is 1x, and should be used if plastanium is not available.
